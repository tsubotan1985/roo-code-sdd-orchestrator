# Unified Spec-Driven Development Workflow: A Practical Guide (v2)

Thank you for downloading the revised workflow configuration files.
This guide provides detailed, **step-by-step instructions** on how to use this framework to generate professional-grade specifications through dialogue with an AI and then proceed seamlessly to implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose & Key Improvements

This revised version fundamentally enhances the AI's thinking process to handle not just functional requirements, but also crucial elements for robust software development, such as **non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)**, **concrete data structures**, and **traceability between requirements and tasks**.

-   **Enhanced AI Persona:** The AI acts as a "Senior System Architect," asking deeper, more systematic questions.
-   **In-depth Requirement Definition:** The process now integrates interviews for non-functional requirements alongside functional ones.
-   **Comprehensive Design:** The design document now mandates sections for test strategy, error handling, and security.
-   **Specific Planning:** Tasks are broken down in greater detail, and traceability to requirements is enforced.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1.  **Download ZIP:** Download all configuration files using the button at the top of the page.
2.  **Extract to Project Root:** Unzip the downloaded file into your project's root directory.
3.  **Edit Project Brief:** Open `projectBrief.md` and customize it to match your project. This step is essential for the AI to understand the high-level context.

## 🚀 Workflow Execution

Choose one of the following two patterns to start development based on your project's current state.

### Pattern A: Kiro Handoff Flow (With a Pre-existing Spec)

Use this pattern when you already have a complete specification (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`), whether generated by Kiro or created manually.

#### Step 1: Activate Orchestrator Mode

In your Roo Code chat, switch to the `Orchestrator` mode, which acts as the implementation project manager.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
/mode orchestrator
```

#### Step 2: Start Implementation

Provide the exact path to your `tasks.md` file to begin the implementation process.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user (replace [feature-name] with the actual folder name)
Execute the plan defined in ./specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md
```
The AI will acknowledge the command and start delegating tasks from `tasks.md` to the `task-executor` mode one by one.

#### Step 3: Monitor Progress

The AI will commit to Git after completing each task. You can monitor the progress in real-time by observing the AI's reports and your Git history.

### Pattern B: Roo Code Spec Generation Flow (From Scratch)

Use this pattern when you have a feature idea but no formal specification yet.

#### Step 1: Activate Architect Mode

Switch to `spec-architect` mode to begin generating the specification from scratch.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
/mode spec-architect
```
> **AI Response (Example):**
> **Current State:** `IDLE`
> "Senior System Architect" mode activated. What feature specification would you like to create?

#### Step 2: Define Requirements & Approve

Describe the feature you want to build. The AI will lead the conversation, asking about functional and non-functional requirements to create `requirements.md`.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user (Example)
I want to create the specification for a user authentication feature.
```
After a dialogue, the AI will present the completed requirements document and ask for your approval.

> **AI Response (Example):**
> ...contents of requirements.md...
> If you are satisfied with the above, please enter "**I approve the requirements**" to proceed to the design phase.

To approve, enter the exact command requested by the AI.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
I approve the requirements
```

#### Step 3: Design & Approve

The AI will transition to the `DESIGN` state and create a technical design (`design.md`) based on the approved requirements.

> **AI Response (Example):**
> **Current State:** `DESIGN`
> Thank you for the approval. Moving to the design phase.
> ...contents of design.md...
> If this design is acceptable, please instruct me by entering "**I approve the design**".

If you are satisfied with the design, enter the approval command.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
I approve the design
```

#### Step 4: Plan Implementation & Approve

The AI will transition to the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN` state and generate a detailed task list (`tasks.md`) from the design document.

> **AI Response (Example):**
> **Current State:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN`
> Understood. Moving to the implementation planning phase.
> ...contents of tasks.md...
> If you are ready to start implementation with this plan, please instruct me by entering "**I approve the plan**".

Review the plan and enter the approval command.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
I approve the plan
```

#### Step 5: Transition to Implementation Phase

Once the plan is approved, the AI will report the completion of the specification phase and prompt you to switch modes for implementation. Follow the instruction and switch to `Orchestrator` mode.

> **AI Response (Example):**
> **Current State:** `DONE`
> The plan has been approved. The specification process is complete.
> We will now begin implementation. Please execute `/mode orchestrator`.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
/mode orchestrator
```

#### Step 6: Start Implementation

Once in `Orchestrator` mode, instruct the AI to execute the plan you just created.

```bash
# Command to be entered by the user
Please execute the plan we just created for the user authentication feature.
```
Since the AI retains the context, it will automatically find the latest `tasks.md` and begin implementation. From here, you can monitor progress as described in Step 3 of Pattern A.
